                <h1>The primary problem: Ozone pollution</h1>
                <p>Ground-level ozone causes more damage to plants, including food crops, than all other air pollutants combined.</p>
                <p>You can observe these effects in  in leaf damage, also called oxidant stipple. However, this kind of evaluation requires following complex manuals, collecting data over long periods of time, taking notes, data analysis, etc. The process needs to be simplified to let everyone in the world collect such data, analyze it instantly, and evaluate the effects of ozone pollution on plant life.</p>

                <h1>The secondary problem: User engagement</h1>
                <p>People are not likely to use an app that just shows ozone damage.</p>
                <p>So, we looked at the bigger picture and realized that people  simply don’t identify plants as well as they identify animals. For example, everyone can distinguish between a cow and a giraffe but not many people can tell the difference between an oak tree and а beech tree.</p>
                <p>We  decided to use this to our advantage and create an app for people who want to learn more about plants.</p>
