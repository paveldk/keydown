                <h1>LeafZone Mobile Application</h1>
                <p>We created a mobile app for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 called Leaf Zone. We chose this name because we didnâ€™t want to focus on the ozone effect itself but rather engage people in discovering the plant life around them.</p>

                <h3>Take a Photo</h3>
                <p>With LeafZone, you can take a photo of a leaf and get instant analysis of the ozone damage on the leaf. You also get information about diseases affecting the plant. If the app cannot recognize a disease, you can easily report it. This can prevent the distribution of new diseases on Earth and, hopefully, one day on other planets we populate.</p>

                <p>The app also shows the species to which the leaf belongs. You no longer need to wonder what plant you are looking at.</p>
